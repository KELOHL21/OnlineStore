      <div class="shop_description_container">
         <p class="shop_description">We started Japanimation to create one spot for all anime fans to find cool anime goods â€” because there wasn't one. We're all about experience, lifestyle, and bringing anime into the bigger conversation.

         Acrylic paint is used on the fabric. It stays permanently on clothing .The fabric is prepared by using a medium and the paint is sealed with a process called heat-setting for optimal results.
         
         We're here to make sure you feel welcome and find everything you're looking for.
